Fetch API sandbox to get data from local resources as well as a remote API.

Thanks to [Enoc](https://github.com/tenvega) for the [original code](https://github.com/tenvega/Fetch-API-Sandbox-Practice).

  - added custom CSS

- **JavaScript**

  - moved js to external file
  - added fetch and promise polyfills
  - added error handling to fetch requests
